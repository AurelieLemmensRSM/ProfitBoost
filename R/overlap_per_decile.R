#' @description
#' Calculate customer overlap between two rankings
#'
#' @details
#' Overlap figure:
#'
#' 1. rank customers according to all methods' scores
#' 2. split in decile
#' 3. calculate per decile, the % customers overlapping in that decile
#'
#' See also Figure 4 in Lemmens, Aur√©lie, and Sunil Gupta.
#' "Managing churn to maximize profits." Marketing Science, (2020).
#'
#' @param score1 estimated score of first method for which to calculate overlap
#' @param score2 estimated score of second method for which to calculate overlap
#' @param splitn number of deciles (default: 10)
#' @param plot whether the overlap curve should be plotted (default: TRUE)
#'
#' @return Percentage Customers Overlapping.
