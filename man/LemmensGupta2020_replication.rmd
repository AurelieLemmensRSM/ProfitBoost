## Preamble

This document is built using R Markdown and shows how to replicate the results of Lemmens and Gupta (2020). Because the data used in the manuscript are subject to a non-disclosure agreement, this document is based on a synthetic dataset, which mimics the original observed data and preserves the relationships between variables but does not contain any disclosive records. As a consequence, results reported in this document are different from the ones reported in the paper. Please note that knitting this file might take a while when using boostrapping (i.e., B greater than 1 in the code), as the file estimates all models tested in the main manuscript, including all benchmark models. A R package is currently under development and will be released soon. You can find the latest information on wwww.aurelielemmens.com. Note that the set of results reported below are for the profit-based loss with left weighting. The code can be adapted as described in the R markdown document to display right weighting or symmetric weigting. 

The replication files include:

* the main code as R Markdown file (LemmensGupta2020_replication.rmd), 
* all functions that the R Markdown file is calling (.r files), 
* and the synthetic dataset (mysynthdata.Rdata or mysynthdata.csv).

## Table 1: Average holdout campaign profit for different estimation methods
```{r Table1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo =FALSE}
k = 4 # selects the weighting scheme, here left weighting
table1 = apply(holdoutprofit[,c(1:3,k)],2,mean,na.rm=T)
names(table1) = c("Uplift Model","Classic Loss","Reordered Classic Loss","Our Approach")
table1 = table1[c(2,3,1,4)]
table1 = t(t(table1)) 
colnames(table1) = c("Holdout Profit")
stargazer(table1,summary=F,type='text',digits = 3,digits.extra = 0, 
          title = paste0('Average campaign holdout profit for different estimation methods (',B," iterations)"))
```

## Table 2: Average holdout campaign profit for different target size determination methods
